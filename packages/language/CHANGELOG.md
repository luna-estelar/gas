## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [`6e96a67`](https://github.com/luna-estelar/gas/commit/6e96a676f2bb48321ad224e5ec28251c168aa2d6) Thanks [@sathira10](https://github.com/sathira10)! - Importing a session no longer loads the GAS compiler. `gas-api` reaches the parser through a
  dynamic import, and `slugify` moves to `gas-protocol`, which both the compiler and a host deriving
  a live track id now share. Every entry point except `@luna-estelar/gas/language` and
  `@luna-estelar/gas/browser/compile` is parser-free, including the umbrella root and
  `browser/session`, and each one is checked by importing it under a resolve hook that rejects
  Langium. `gas-language` also declares `sideEffects: false`.

  `submitLiveCommands` no longer discards a command accepted while it was preparing. It read the
  session state before resolving the source, then wrote its result after, so a programmatic command
  that committed in between — during a `sourceUrl`, `sourceFile` or `sourceBlob` read — was applied
  and then silently lost. The state is now read after that wait, and nothing yields between reading
  it and committing.

  The Lyria connector converts tempo before sending it. A GAS tempo counts the meter's `beatUnit`,
  while Lyria's `bpm` counts quarter notes, so the connector now sends `tempo * 4 / beatUnit` and
  decides clamping against that value. Previously a document in any meter other than `x/4` was
  generated at a different tempo than the Renderer's clock assumed, and the two drifted apart.
  `ConnectorTiming.tempo` documents the unit so no other connector repeats this.

  `openAudioContext` no longer waits indefinitely for `resume()`. A browser that refuses to start
  audio may leave that promise pending rather than rejecting, which made `createBrowserSession`
  never resolve — the host received no context at all, and so could not offer the gesture that
  would have fixed it. The wait is now bounded and `resumed` still comes from `context.state`.
  `BrowserSession` additionally exposes its `context`, so a host can read `state`, watch
  `statechange` and retry `resume()` itself. Ownership is unchanged: `close()` still closes only a
  context the session opened.

  **Breaking:** `PlaybackEngine.fadeOut` and `PlaybackEngine.restoreGain` are removed. Nothing in
  the library called either, and every engine implementation had to provide them.

  **Breaking:** `RendererStatusEvent.throttled` now reports only the Renderer's own flow control. A
  provider reporting that it slowed down continues to arrive as `stream === 'throttled'`; the two
  were previously merged into `throttled`, which left a host unable to tell a model struggling to
  keep up from one being deliberately restrained.

  `ChainedSourceEngine.flush` is now a no-op once the engine is closed, matching `push` and `close`.

  **Breaking:** every package's `packageName` constant is removed. `version` stays, and
  `@luna-estelar/gas-protocol` additionally exports `slugify`.

  **Breaking:** `CreateRendererOptions.anchor` is removed. Musical time always starts at the first
  audible sample, which is what makes the Renderer's clock agree with what a listener hears. The
  other setting anchored at `connector.start()`, before any audio existed, and only existed to
  restore the timing that predated that fix.

  **Breaking:** `CreateRendererOptions.checkConnectorContract` is removed and the check it gated now
  always runs. A connector whose own `validateConfig` rejects its own advertised `defaultConfig` is
  refused at `createRenderer`, rather than passing initialization and failing confusingly later.

  Every package README points its build badge at the workflow that now runs on `main`.

  **Breaking:** `GasSession.loadTimeline` takes only the timeline. Its second `CompileOptions`
  argument was accepted and ignored; a loaded timeline is already compiled.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [`a8009b8`](https://github.com/luna-estelar/gas/commit/a8009b820f771736efc683c4d78a57d17577e439) Thanks [@sathira10](https://github.com/sathira10)! - Internal dependency ranges widened to caret, so each package can be released on its own.

- [`b98522b`](https://github.com/luna-estelar/gas/commit/b98522bb8a61fb00b5cbb2f4ca7e8f4557d07c7b) Thanks [@sathira10](https://github.com/sathira10)! - The generated TextMate grammar now ships in the tarball as `syntaxes/gas.tmLanguage.json`, for
  editors and static highlighters.

- [`864382a`](https://github.com/luna-estelar/gas/commit/864382a00805593b954301351f3938e6e503fd74) Thanks [@sathira10](https://github.com/sathira10)! - README rewritten to the shared layout: install, a complete example, an exports table, runtime
  support and related packages. The notation README now documents the Alda subset it accepts and
  what raises `AldaParseError`.
- Updated dependencies [[`a8009b8`](https://github.com/luna-estelar/gas/commit/a8009b820f771736efc683c4d78a57d17577e439), [`2ad4e1f`](https://github.com/luna-estelar/gas/commit/2ad4e1fb94f1dbd36e32b0e06b27630012830cf2)]:
  - @luna-estelar/gas-protocol@0.2.0

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Released with the Protocol validator fix; no changes to this package.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First public preview. Parses, validates and compiles GAS documents and live fragments
  into model-independent timelines in musical time. Package APIs may change in minor
  releases before 1.0.
