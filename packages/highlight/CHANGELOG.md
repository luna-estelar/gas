## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [`6e96a67`](https://github.com/luna-estelar/gas/commit/6e96a676f2bb48321ad224e5ec28251c168aa2d6) Thanks [@sathira10](https://github.com/sathira10)! - Importing a session no longer loads the GAS compiler. `gas-api` reaches the parser through a
  dynamic import, and `slugify` moves to `gas-protocol`, which both the compiler and a host deriving
  a live track id now share. Every entry point except `@luna-estelar/gas/language` and
  `@luna-estelar/gas/browser/compile` is parser-free, including the umbrella root and
  `browser/session`, and each one is checked by importing it under a resolve hook that rejects
  Langium. `gas-language` also declares `sideEffects: false`.

  `submitLiveCommands` no longer discards a command accepted while it was preparing. It read the
  session state before resolving the source, then wrote its result after, so a programmatic command
  that committed in between — during a `sourceUrl`, `sourceFile` or `sourceBlob` read — was applied
  and then silently lost. The state is now read after that wait, and nothing yields between reading
  it and committing.

  The Lyria connector converts tempo before sending it. A GAS tempo counts the meter's `beatUnit`,
  while Lyria's `bpm` counts quarter notes, so the connector now sends `tempo * 4 / beatUnit` and
  decides clamping against that value. Previously a document in any meter other than `x/4` was
  generated at a different tempo than the Renderer's clock assumed, and the two drifted apart.
  `ConnectorTiming.tempo` documents the unit so no other connector repeats this.

  `openAudioContext` no longer waits indefinitely for `resume()`. A browser that refuses to start
  audio may leave that promise pending rather than rejecting, which made `createBrowserSession`
  never resolve — the host received no context at all, and so could not offer the gesture that
  would have fixed it. The wait is now bounded and `resumed` still comes from `context.state`.
  `BrowserSession` additionally exposes its `context`, so a host can read `state`, watch
  `statechange` and retry `resume()` itself. Ownership is unchanged: `close()` still closes only a
  context the session opened.

  **Breaking:** `PlaybackEngine.fadeOut` and `PlaybackEngine.restoreGain` are removed. Nothing in
  the library called either, and every engine implementation had to provide them.

  **Breaking:** `RendererStatusEvent.throttled` now reports only the Renderer's own flow control. A
  provider reporting that it slowed down continues to arrive as `stream === 'throttled'`; the two
  were previously merged into `throttled`, which left a host unable to tell a model struggling to
  keep up from one being deliberately restrained.

  `ChainedSourceEngine.flush` is now a no-op once the engine is closed, matching `push` and `close`.

  **Breaking:** every package's `packageName` constant is removed. `version` stays, and
  `@luna-estelar/gas-protocol` additionally exports `slugify`.

  **Breaking:** `CreateRendererOptions.anchor` is removed. Musical time always starts at the first
  audible sample, which is what makes the Renderer's clock agree with what a listener hears. The
  other setting anchored at `connector.start()`, before any audio existed, and only existed to
  restore the timing that predated that fix.

  **Breaking:** `CreateRendererOptions.checkConnectorContract` is removed and the check it gated now
  always runs. A connector whose own `validateConfig` rejects its own advertised `defaultConfig` is
  refused at `createRenderer`, rather than passing initialization and failing confusingly later.

  Every package README points its build badge at the workflow that now runs on `main`.

  **Breaking:** `GasSession.loadTimeline` takes only the timeline. Its second `CompileOptions`
  argument was accepted and ignored; a loaded timeline is already compiled.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [`a8009b8`](https://github.com/luna-estelar/gas/commit/a8009b820f771736efc683c4d78a57d17577e439) Thanks [@sathira10](https://github.com/sathira10)! - Internal dependency ranges widened to caret, so each package can be released on its own.

- [`b98522b`](https://github.com/luna-estelar/gas/commit/b98522bb8a61fb00b5cbb2f4ca7e8f4557d07c7b) Thanks [@sathira10](https://github.com/sathira10)! - Unused direct dependencies removed. The CLI no longer declares Protocol or Core, neither of which
  it imported; it still depends on the language package for compilation, so installing it still
  brings the parser. The highlight helpers declare their own token types instead of depending on the
  language package, so installing them pulls in neither the parser, Langium, nor Chevrotain.

- [`864382a`](https://github.com/luna-estelar/gas/commit/864382a00805593b954301351f3938e6e503fd74) Thanks [@sathira10](https://github.com/sathira10)! - README rewritten to the shared layout: install, a complete example, an exports table, runtime
  support and related packages. The notation README now documents the Alda subset it accepts and
  what raises `AldaParseError`.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Released with the Protocol validator fix; no changes to this package.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First public preview. Syntax-presentation helpers, depending on the language package
  type-only so it never loads the parser. Package APIs may change in minor releases before
  1.0.
